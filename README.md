### Instructions
A rover has been sent to Mars and we have to control its movements from Earth. For this, we have to create a series of commands that allow us to give direction and movement to the rover.

Bonus added:
 * Create a function that allows to move the rover backwards
 * Create an alert that alerts the user if he enters an incorrect command
 * Generate obstacles on Mars and notify the rover if it has hit one
